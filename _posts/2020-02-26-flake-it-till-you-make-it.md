R is incredible software for statistics and data science. But while the bits and bytes of software are an essential component of its usefulness, software needs a community to be successful. And that's an area where R really shines, as Shannon Ellis explains in this lovely ROpenSci blog post. For software, a thriving community offers developers, expertise, collaborators, writers and documentation, testers, agitators (to keep the community and software on track!), and so much more. Shannon provides links where you can find all of this in the R community

Use the help available from the Help menu in R
There are many options available on the Help menu, the most useful to us are: Manuals, Search Help, R functions, and HTML help. The names of each one are fairly descriptive. Try them out to see where they take you.

Use the help() command
To find information for a particular function, such as the function print, type help('print') on the R command line and press enter (I recommend using quotes whenever you use this command, but there are some special cases when they are unnecessary). This will open up a window with information on how to use the required function.

Typing help() on the R command line and pressing enter will open a window telling you a bit on how to use the help()command
Alternatively, the same results can be achieved by typing a question mark followed by the name of the command to query. For instance, to bring up the help file for the function print, type ?print into the command line.
