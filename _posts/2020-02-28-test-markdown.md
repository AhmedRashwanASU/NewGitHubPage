Open-source softwares have a high standard of quality, since multiple people use and iterate on them. Learn More, [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](https://markdowntutorial.com/) 

**Here is some bold text**

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
