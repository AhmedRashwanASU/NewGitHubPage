You all must be wondering there are already so many tools that help you achieve data visualization and certain amount of analytics!

R is one of the latest cutting-edge tools. Today, millions of analysts, researchers, and brands such as Facebook, Google, Bing, Accenture, Wipro are using R to solve complex issues. The applications of R are not limited to just one sector, we can see the use of R in banking, e-commerce, finance, and many more sectors. This article will make you familiar with the real-life analogies of the R programming language.

### R Histoty 

R is an implementation of the S programming language combined with lexical scoping semantics, inspired by Scheme. S was created by John Chambers in 1976 while at Bell Labs. A commercial version of S was offered as S-PLUS starting in 1988.

Much of the code written for S-PLUS runs unaltered in R.

In 1991 Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, began an alternative implementation of the basic S language, completely independent of S-PLUS, which they began publicizing in 1993 It was named partly after the first names of the first two R authors and partly as a play on the name of S. In 1995, Martin Maechler convinced Ihaka and Gentleman to make R free and open-source software under Version 2 of the GNU General Public License. The R Core Team was formed in 1997 to further develop the language. As of 2021, it consisted of Gentleman, Ihaka, and Maechler, plus Douglas Bates, John Chambers, Peter Dalgaard, Kurt Hornik, Tomas Kalibera, Michael Lawrence, Friedrich Leisch, Uwe Ligges, Thomas Lumley, Martin Morgan, Paul Murrell, Martyn Plummer, Brian Ripley, Deepayan Sarkar, Duncan Temple Lang, Luke Tierney, and Simon Urbanek. Heiner Schwarte, Guido Masarotto, Stefano Iacus, Seth Falcon, and Duncan Murdoch were also formerly members.

The first official release came in 1995. The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) was officially announced 23 April 1997 with 3 mirrors and 12 contributed packages.[16] The first official "stable beta" version (v1.0) was released 29 February 2000.
