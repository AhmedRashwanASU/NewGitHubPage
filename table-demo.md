Create a Liquid Table

Using the Barebones Jekyll Custom Table example add a page with a custom table.

Copy the liquid-table.html template and add it as a new layout in your site’s layout folder. You will need to change the parent page template on the liquid-table.html page to “default” or “page” in your new site (you don’t have a nice-text layout that you can use as the parent page layout).
